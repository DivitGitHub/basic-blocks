# BasicBlocks

This project shows the simple blockchain functionality. It creates a block with a digital signature (in this case our hash) and also stores the previous block hash. This also mines/validates existing blocks.

## What I've used
Java 11

Maven

Gson

## To start
Run the Application.java class

## Console after running
```
Mining block 1... 
Block Mined! Block hash: 00000bc84417f31f3935cec1bd7990ee6a709fc6aaefbd389c19dcd4861dcf37

Blockchain is Valid: true

The block chain: 
[

### About
I created this project for fun and to allow me have a basic understand of how blockchain works.
